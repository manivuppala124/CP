/*A secret agent receives a list of encrypted codewords. 
Each codeword must follow the same symbol sequence as a given prototype code. 
Your mission is to find which codewords follow the same symbol arrangement.

NOTE:
Matching is not about the actual characters, but how they repeat.
For example, “moon” = m o o n → pattern: first letter, two repeated letters, and a unique last letter.

-------------
Line-1: A space-separated list of words 
Line-2: A string representing the reference pattern
