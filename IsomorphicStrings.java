/*You are given two strings. Determine whether the first string can be converted to the second 
by replacing each character with a unique character while preserving the order.

Each character from the first string must map to one and only one character in the second string and vice versa.
Note: Two characters in the first string cannot map to the same character in the second.

Explanation:
------------
Two strings are isomorphic if:
•	Each character in the first-string maps to one unique character in the second string.
•	This mapping must be consistent throughout the string.
•	No two different characters from the first-string map to the same character in the second string.


Input Format:
-------------------
Line-1: two space-separated strings

Output Format:
----------------------
Line-1: Boolean value True/False


Sample Input-1:
---------------
ACAB XCXY

Sample Output:
----------------------
True

Explanation:
------------
A → X, C → C, B → Y — all mappings are unique and consistent.


Sample Input:
---------------------
FOO BAR

Sample Output:
----------------------
False
