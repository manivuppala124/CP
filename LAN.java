/*In your computer lab, network switches are connected using Ethernet cables to form a LAN. 
However, a new hardware technician inadvertently connected switches in a way that created a cycle,
resulting in a network loop. 
As a consequence, the network has become unstable. You need to identify and remove the specific cable that 
is causing the loop. 
If there are multiple cables contributing to the loop, you should remove the one that was most recently added
