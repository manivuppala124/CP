/*Given an array of integers arr, you are initially positioned at the first index of the array.

In one step you can jump from index i to index:
-> i + 1 where: i + 1 < arr.length.
-> i - 1 where: i - 1 >= 0.
-> j where: arr[i] == arr[j] and i != j.
-> Return the minimum number of steps to reach the last index of the array.

Notice that you can not jump outside of the array at any time.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
100 -23 -23 404 100 23 23 23 3 404

Sample Output-1:
---------------
3

Explanation: You need three jumps from index 0 --> 4 --> 3 --> 9. 
Note that index 9 is the last index of the array.

Sample Input-2:
---------------
1
7

Sample Output-2: 
----------------
0

Explanation: Start index is the last index. You do not need to jump.

Sample Input-3:
---------------
8
7 6 9 6 9 6 9 7

Sample Output-3: 
----------------
1

Explanation: You can jump directly from index 0 to index 7 which is last index of the array.
 
Constraints:
------------
-> 1 <= arr.length <= 5 * 104
-> -108 <= arr[i] <= 108 */
