/*Imagine you're the master chef in a renowned kitchen, tasked with preparing a 
spectacular dinner consisting of numDishes unique dishes, labeled from 
0 to numDishes - 1. However, the recipes have dependencies—certain dishes can 
only be prepared after completing others. You’re given a list called dependecies, 
where each element dependencies[i] = [Xi, Yi] means that you must finish 
preparing dish Yi before starting dish Xi.

For instance, the pair [2, 1] implies that to create dish 2, 
dish 1 must be prepared first.

Return the ordering of dishes that a chef should take to finish all dishes.
	- the result set should follow the given order of conditions.
	- If it is impossible to complete all dishes, return an empty set.


Input Format:
-------------
Line-1: An integer numDishes, number of Dishes.
Line-2: An integer m, number of dependencies.
Next m lines: Two space separated integers, Xi and Yi.

Output Format:
--------------
Return a list of integers, the ordering of dishes that a chef should finish.

Sample Input-1:
---------------
4
3
1 2
3 0
0 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[2, 1, 0, 3]

Explanation: There are 4 dishes. Since dish 1 requires dish 2, dish 3 requires 
dish 0 and dish 0 requires dish 1, you can prepare dishes in the order 2 1 0 3.


Sample Input-2:
---------------
2
2
1 0
0 1

Sample Output-1:
----------------
[]

Explanation: There are 2 dishes, but dish 1 depends on dish 0 and dish 0 depends 
on dish 1. This circular dependency makes it impossible to prepare all dishes.

Constraints:
------------
- 1 <= numDishes <= 2000  
- 0 <= m <= 5000  
- dependencies[i].length == 2  
- 0 <= Xi, Yi < numDishes  
- All the dependency pairs are unique.
